# AdventOfCode2020

Working on Advent of Code for more practice with Julia. Focusing this year on idiomatic Julia and test-driven development.

Each file is independently executable and output results to the REPL. E.g., 
```julia
julia> include("src/day_01.jl")
[ Info: Day 1, Part 1 answer: xxx
[ Info: Day 1, Part 2 answer: yyy
```

Run tests from package manager with `test`:
```julia
(AdventOfCode2020) pkg> test
```
